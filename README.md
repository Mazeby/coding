<b>Random Coding Stuff</b>

Just a place for all my scripts and random stuff I create. Most of them just have random purposes, but I will list them here:

1. <b>Commontoolscript:</b> Just a script I wrote which makes updating repositories and removing unused packages, as well as fixing a random xhost priviledge error when I was running any graphical interface as root. Includes a full menu and is probably common as hell.
