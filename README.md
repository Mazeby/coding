<b>Random Coding Stuff</b>

Just a place for all my scripts and random stuff I create. Most of them just have random purposes, but I will list them here:

1. <b>[SHELL] Commontoolscript:</b> Just a script I wrote which makes updating repositories and removing unused packages, as well as fixing a random xhost priviledge error when I was running any graphical interface as root. Just place it into your home directory and it should work out of the box. Includes a full menu and is probably common as hell.

2. <b>[SHELL] NewUserScript:</b> A simple script for adding a new user in Ubuntu/Debian.
